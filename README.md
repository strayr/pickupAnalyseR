A project to produce analysis of guitar pickups using R

THIS MIGHT WORK, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PRE-ALPHA

Purpose
=======

To take CSV data produced from a bode plotter and produce nice plots and calculate key electrical properties.


History
=======

This started from discussions on GuitarNuts on analysing the frequency response of guitar pickups.

Dependancies
============
tidyverse 
ggplot2 (in tidyverse)
scales  (in tidyverse)

For melting data:
